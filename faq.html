          A computer with Firefox/Chrome.
We suggest using these two browsers, as they ensure maximum compatibility.
Mobile navigation is also garanteed.
Navigation from multiple computers is also allowed.

    A digital wallet
        To buy a star, you will need a digital wallet, specifically MetaMask.
        As your digital wallet acts as a real one, you’ll need to put money in        it in order to do your first purchase.
WallOfChain does not have any control over your wallet, that belongs only to you. Please do not share with others your seeds words: they can restore your account in the case it’s deleted, but they can also garantee access to your entire account.
Your wallet is univocally identified by a wallet address. You can share it with other, and it’s used to convey assets to your wallet.

      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          Ethereum is a digital currency – its value, like any other currency, fluctuates with the market.
In order to convert your actual currency in Ethereum, you can use the Coinbase.
Some wallets allow the possibilty to directly aquire Ethereum currency, while others may require you to make a purchase from an exchange. After your purchase, you can transfer your Ethereum from the exchange wallet to your digital one.
Keep in mind it’s not the shortest process: you’ll need to verify your identity, which will probably take a day or two.
Worry not – your star awaits for you.

      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          Etherscan is an interface for the Ethereum Network. It has a memory of everything that’s happened on the blockchain. In this way, you can be 100% sure that your transactions were successful.
        </p></article></div><div class="accordion"><input id="faq-3" name="faq-selected" type="radio" class="accordion__input"> <label for="faq-3" class="accordion__label"><i class="accordion__icon"></i> My transaction failed
      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          It is possible that the setting level of the gas limit was too low.
        </p></article></div><div class="accordion"><input id="faq-4" name="faq-selected" type="radio" class="accordion__input"> <label for="faq-4" class="accordion__label"><i class="accordion__icon"></i> My transaction failed, but my gas was charged
      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          Gas is essential to process requests on the blockchain. In this sense, even a failed transaction still represents a transaction.
This fee is payed to the Ethereum network and miners, and not to WallOfChain.

      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          It’s possible that the Ethereum network may be too busy to process the transaction. It usually happens when gas prices are too high, or there is a spike in network congestion.
        </p></article></div><div class="accordion"><input id="faq-6" name="faq-selected" type="radio" class="accordion__input"> <label for="faq-6" class="accordion__label"><i class="accordion__icon"></i> Ok, but what is gas?
      </label> <article class="accordion__content"><p class="accordion__copy">
          Gas is a short term used to describe the cost of a transaction or contract in Ethereum.
Each transaction takes a lot of computational power, and is splitted beneath multiple computers. This power is covered by gas.
